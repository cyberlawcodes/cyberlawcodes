    ##################### MY TECH JOURNEY AND MISSION  #####################
      
    * In April, 2021, I started my journey to becoming a product manager/developer. üòé    
    
    * I am particularly interested in finding ways to make law more accessible to consumers and businesses.  
    
        * In 2019, the California State Bar published a study in which it identified a gap in justice for Californians. 
    
        * The gap includes: (1) a knowledge gap; and (2) services gap. 
          https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Access-to-Justice/Initiatives/California-Justice-Gap-Study/Justice-Gap-Study-Survey-Data 
      
        * The results of this study mirrors a national study that found similar gaps in justice for US citizens. 
          www.lsc.gov/research-data
    
        * One of the California Bar's recommendations is to make online legal information easier to search and find. 
        
        * Another recommendation is to explore possible partnerships between lawyers and tech to build tools to solve justice gap issues. 
        
        * Arizona and Utah have both implemented regulatory sandboxes to test innovative legal products and partnerships between lawyers and tech                   companies. https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/law_practice_magazine/2021/ja21/siegel/
        
        * California's State Bar has a task force that is also looking at adopting changes similar to Arizona and Utah - next report to be released in             September, 2022.  https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/law_practice_magazine/2021/ja21/siegel/
    
        * It's my goal to help find and develop user-centric solutions.  I like to call this, "Friendly Law as a Service" or "FLaaS". üåà
    
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in so many things, my friends! This is an incredibly exciting time to be a lawyer and developer! ü§ì

    * Creating amazing user experiences for consumers and businesses that need to find legal information. 
    
    * Finding ways to reduce the costs of solving legal problems for consumers and businesses.
    
    * Promoting alternatives to litigation like mediation and arbitration so that consumers and businesses can save time and money. 
    
    * Developing smart contract use cases and building Dapps on blockchain.  
    
    * Using AI and ML for legal prediction [analysis of statutes, administrative agency rulings, and case law for regulatory purposes].

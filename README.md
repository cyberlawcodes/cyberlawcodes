# Greetings

Hello. I am a California lawyer and developer. Email me at cyberlawcodes@gmail.com. In 2019, and after handling over 600 litigation cases, I started my journey to becoming a tech professional.

## Software Development Bootcamp

I completed the nucamp software development bootcamp (MERN/Python/DevOps) while traveling and living in Latin America.  During this time, I also researched and analyzed the changes taking place in the legal industry and to the general marketplace in response to the Corona pandemic.  

## Design Mindset to Better Understanding Users and Developing Products

While working on portfolio projects, I realized that coding and market research was not enough.  I was selecting projects based on what I thought might be helpful - based on my own experiences as a lawyer and industry reports (like the California State Bar's 2019 Justice Gap Report).  But the market and user needs had changed dramatically since 2019.  And without proper design, the best logic in the world would probably fail to serve intended audiences.  So my journey's path led me to user experience.  I'm particularly interested in adapting deesign thinking to define and validate ideas.  The application of user research to solving legal problems is expected create a road map to better product development.  Idea validation and flexible, consistently tested roadmaps should, in turn, lead to efficient and agile processes. Currently, I am conducting and publishing my own case studies.

## Justice Gap + Tech 

In 2019, the California State Bar published a study in which it identified a gap in justice for Californians. 
- The gap includes: 
     - (1) a knowledge gap and 
     - (2) services gap [California Justice Gap Study](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Access-to-Justice/Initiatives/California-Justice-Gap-Study/Justice-Gap-Study-Survey-Data)
- The results of this study mirrors a national study that found similar gaps in justice for US citizens. 
     - [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/our-impact/publications/other-publications-and-reports/justice-gap-report)
- One of the California Bar's recommendations is to make online legal information easier to search and find. 
- Another recommendation is to explore possible partnerships between lawyers and tech to build tools to solve justice gap issues. 
- Arizona and Utah have both implemented regulatory sandboxes to test innovative legal products and partnerships between lawyers and tech                   companies. 
     - [American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/law_practice_magazine/2021/ja21/siegel/)
- California's State Bar has a task force that is also looking at adopting changes similar to Arizona and Utah - next report to be released in             September, 2022.

# Greetings

Hello. I am an artist, developer, and lawyer. In 2019, and after handling over 600 litigation cases, I started my jouney of finding ways to solve problems with tech.  Having absolutely no tech background, this meant that I had a lot of learning to do.  Since then, 

 - I completed a software developmnent bootcamp (MERN/Python/DevOps) with nucamp; 
 - I completed Y Combinator's start-up school curriculum; and
 - I am completing UX classes/projects with Interaction Design Foundation.   

## My goal is to: 

- Effectively identify and design for problems that people care about; 
- Efficiently use existing tools to prototype, test, and reiterate the best possible products and content; and 
- Execute solutions with a start-up.   

## Projects I am working on: 

- Conducting User Research to answer the following question:  How can tech help to solve California's knowledge and services gap?  
     - [California Task Force](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/factSheets/Closing-the-Justice-Gap-Working-Group-Fact-Sheet.pdf) 
     - [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/our-impact/publications/other-publications-and-reports/justice-gap-report)
     - [American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/law_practice_magazine/2021/ja21/siegel/)
     
- Developing solution(s) with my sister [a 20+ year critical care nurse] for the following problem:  What products might be helpful in addressing nationwide nursing burnout? we are now working on an MVP for Nursetality, a personalized digital coaching app for nurses.

## My Creative Side    

I am a painter with modern influences, particularly Latin American/German Expressionism.  Twice, I exhibited at the Dia De Los Muertos festival (Hollywood Forever Cemetery), Los Angeles, California.
